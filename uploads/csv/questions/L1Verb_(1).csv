1,"Many people with high IQ scores fail to become successful due to lack of motivation, laziness, or short attention span. In contrast, some people with low IQ succeed with greater personal dedication, systematic effort, and motivation. One can eliminate the disadvantage that comes with a low IQ score by choosing the right career path. For example, one might have special talents for a particular sport while failing to perform as well as the others academically. This can be justified with greater motivation and dedication. Individuals will have greater motivation in pursuing careers they are skilled. They will like it more and put more effort in it. One of the best ways parents can help is to help their children discover themselves and their skills.",The passage says that:,High IQ scores are necessary for success,High IQ scores make a person choose a successful career path,High IQ scores are not an indicator of success,None of the above,3

4,"One of the astronomers selected for the search was Giuseppe Piazzi, a Catholic priest at the Academy of Palermo, Sicily. Piazzi discovered Ceres on 1 January 1801. Instead of a star, Piazzi had found a moving starlike object, which he first thought was a comet. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, slightly closer to Mars' orbit. Its diameter is approximately 945 kilometers (587 miles), making it the largest of the minor planets within the orbit of Neptune. Earth radius is the approximately 7 times of Ceres's i.e 6,371 km (3,959 mi). Ceres was the first asteroid to be discovered (by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory on 1 January 1801). The early observers were only able to calculate the size of Ceres to within an order of magnitude. Herschel underestimated its diameter as 260 km in 1802, whereas in 1811 Johann Hieronymus Schröter overestimated it as 2,613 km. Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned.",Ceres was discovered in?,16th century,18th century,20th century,None of the above,4

7,"Air masses and fronts have an effect on the weather throughout the world, affecting everyone everywhere. An air mass is a large region of the atmosphere containing a volume of air defined by its temperature and moisture content. In an air mass the temperatures and amount of moisture is about the same throughout the region. There are different air masses throughout the world which mostly control the weather in that region. In the United States, global winds tend to move air masses from east to west. When different air masses come together and meet the boundary is called a front. The air masses do not mix together. A front is the narrow area or boundary where the air masses meet. Along this front is where the weather changes most rapidly. There are two fronts to be most familiar with and which are heard of most often. A cold front and a warm front. A cold front occurs at a warm air mass where the weather changes as cold air moves in. A warm front occurs when warm air moves over a cold air mass. Fog may also be a result of a warm front moving into a cold air mass. Another type of front also involves a cold front and a warm front. An occluded front occurs when a cold front overtakes a warm front. When this happens the warm air is separated at the Earth's surface. When an occluded front occurs it is most likely lead to precipitation such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, depending on the air temperature and season of the year. After the cold front passes though, the temperatures will usually begin to get warmer again. One final type of front is called a stationary front. A stationary front occurs when a cold air mass and a warm air mass meets. There is usually a drastic temperature change before the cold and warm air masses meet as well as a change in the direction of the wind. The stationary front may also stay over an area for days or weeks, or sometimes even longer. It is not moving and the weather it brings changes very little. On a weather map the different fronts are shown by different symbols and colors. A cold front is represented by a blue line with triangles pointing toward the direction of movement. A warm front is represented as a red line with half circles pointing toward the direction of movement. A stationary front is represented as an alternating warm and cold front symbol. An occluded front is represented as a purple line with teeth and half circles.",Which of the following is a large region of the atmosphere containing a volume of air defined by its temperature and moisture content?,Air pressure,Air front,Air mass,Stationary air,2

10,"World War Z is a 2013 American action horror film directed by Marc Forster. The screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard, and Lindelof is from a screen story by Carnahan and Straczynski, based on the title of the 2006 novel of the same name by Max Brooks. The film stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator who must travel the world to find a way to stop a zombie pandemic. Pitt's Plan B Entertainment secured the film rights in 2007, and Forster was approached to direct. In 2009, Carnahan was hired to rewrite the script. Filming began in July 2011 in Malta, on an estimated $125 million budget, before moving to Glasgow in August 2011 and Budapest in October 2011. Originally set for a December 2012 release, the production suffered some setbacks. World War Z premiered in London on June 2, 2013, and was chosen to open the 35th Moscow International Film Festival.

12,"The 2010 FIFA World Cup was the 19th FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football teams. It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations; in 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals. The matches were played in 10 stadiums in nine host cities around the country, with the final played at the Soccer City stadium in South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg. Thirty-two teams were selected for participation via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007. In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage, where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final. In the final, Spain, the European champions, defeated the Netherlands (third-time losing finalists) 1–0 after extra time, with Andrés Iniesta's goal in the 116th minute giving Spain their first world title. Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa, 2006 champions Italy and 2006 runnersup France were all eliminated in the first round of the tournament. It was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first round. New Zealand, with their three draws, were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but they were also eliminated in the first round.",Which was the only team in the FIFA World Cup 2010 which neither won nor lost a match?,Spain,Brazil,New Zealand,South Africa,2
